# Ocean Invaders

You are an octopus who loves eating crabs, but lives under constant threat of alien invasion,
while facing the threats of a trecherous ocean ecosystem. Shoot invaders out of the sky and
consume your weight in crabs, but watch out for eels and sharks!

If you want to run this project from your local machine, download the project into an environment that supports Java (VSCode, Eclipse, IntelliJ), and run the main script (/Ocean-Invaders/My2DGame/src/main).
